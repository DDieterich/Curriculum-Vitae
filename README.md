Your suspicions are correct. We are not here because of random chance. There is a Creator and He loves us so much that He gave His only Son to die for us.

[Psalms 111:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+111:10&version=ESV)

*The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all those who practice it have a good understanding.*
